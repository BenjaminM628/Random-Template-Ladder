        It sounds like you already have a handle on how to do a RR. I can give you a short explanation on how you would do a single-elimination tournament. 

To the Game table, add two integers: RoundNumber and PositionFromTop. RoundNumber is 0 for all first-round games, 1 for second-round games, etc. PositionFromTop is 0 for the uppermost game of that round, and increments as you go down. 

Starting the tournament is easy. Just create all of the first-round games (RoundNumber = 0) and increment PositionFromTop for each one. WarLight matches players randomly, but you may want to seed them based on the previous tournament. 

Then, after each game finishes, just check if the game above/below it is also finished. If both are finished, then create the next round game from the winners of those two.
